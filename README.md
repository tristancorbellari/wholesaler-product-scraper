# Wholesaler Product Scraper
Built for Scrapfinity (https://scrapfinity.co.za/).

This elegant application dynamically retrieves a list of products to be sold by scrapbooking company Scrapfinity, namely those from supplier The Wholesaler (https://www.thewholesaler.biz/). The code scrapes the suppliers website for all suitable products from selected categories, then processes and stores all data in a CSV format which is then suitable for easy mass-importing into Shopify.

## Demonstration
